# HOW DOES THE INTERNET WORK ?

It's easier than you think! The internet is basically a big wire to which computers connect through different means *(fiber, copper, etc.)* to be able to communicate to each other through a net of routers.

There are two types of computers that connect to the internet:

- **Servers**
- **Personal computers**

| | Servers | PCs |
|---|---|---|
| Connection type | Direct | Through ISP |
| Holds webpages | Y | N |
| Has an IP address | Y | Y |

IP addresses (like *72.14.205.100*) are how computers connected to the internet find each other. To make it easier for humans, those IP addresses are linked to names such as **Google.com** or **Facebook.com**. But when you write that address in your browser of choice, it's actually the IP address number that gets sent down the wire.

### So what exactly happens when I type google.com on my browser ?

1. Your computer sends the address to your Internet Service Provider
2. Your ISP forwards the address to one or several routers until it reachs the Google server
3. The Google server fetches the information you are requesting and sends it back through the routers

Since your computer has its own unique ISP address, it does not matter how many computers are connected to the same ISP. The information always reachs the right address!
